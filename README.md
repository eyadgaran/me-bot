# messaging-bot
Personal chatbot trained with texts and facebook messages

##Setup
Repo contains two main directories, mbot and data

Code and settings go in mbot, while raw data and generated objects live under data/

To create the python environment use the `conda_requirements.yaml` file or execute `deployment.sh`

Training depends on message files so make sure to copy whatever you want to use into the `data/raw` folder.
(For facebook you need to export your personal data and copy the messages folder)
